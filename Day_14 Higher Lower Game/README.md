# <h2>Higher Lower Game 🐍</h2>

Higher Lower Game is a basic game using most followed account's data in Instagram.
At the beginning of the game, 2 random accounts data are shown to the player.
```bash
Compare A: Taylor Swift, a Musician, from United States 🇺🇸
🆚
Against B: David Beckham, a Footballer, from United Kingdom 🇬🇧
```
Then the user is going to guess which account has more followers in Instagram. If player's guess is right,
then the game continues and the next account is going to be shown and the previous B account, becomes A.
The game continues until the player makes a wrong guess :)
