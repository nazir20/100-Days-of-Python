- The deck is unlimited in size. 
- There are no jokers. 
- The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
- The Ace can count as 11 or 1.
- Use the following list as the deck of cards:
- cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
- The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
- Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
- The computer is the dealer.

```bash

    userCards = [10, 5, 6], totalScore = 21
    computerCards = [1,6,8], totalScore = 15 
    -*-*-*-*-*-*- 
    winner = user
