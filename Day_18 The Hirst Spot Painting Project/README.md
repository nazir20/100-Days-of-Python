# <h3>The Hirst Spot Painting Project</h3>
'The Hirst Spot Painting' is a basic project coded by turtle module in Python.
At first, the colors used in 'Damien Hirst' spot painting is being extracted from the painting image
and then stored inside a list through the <a href='https://pypi.org/project/colorgram.py/'>colorgram.py</a>
module in python. After that, through using turtle module, the same spot painting is being generated
by using the colors extracted from the 'Damien Hirst' painting.
<a href='https://pypi.org/project/colorgram.py/'>colorgram.py</a> is a Python library that lets you extract colors from images. Compared to other libraries, the colorgram algorithmâ€™s results are more intense.
