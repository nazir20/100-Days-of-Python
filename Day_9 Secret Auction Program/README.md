# secret Auction(Blind Auction) Program

Secret Auction is a common type of auction. It is also known as blind auction. In this type of auction, all bidders simultaneously submit sealed bids so that no bidder knows the bid of any other participant. The highest bidder pays the price that was submitted.
This program is a good practice for Dictionaries in Python.
```bash
EX:
Inputs:
  'Egemen': 210$
  'Ezgi': 450$
  'Yaman': 90$
Output: 
  The winner is 'Ezgi' with 450$ bid
```
