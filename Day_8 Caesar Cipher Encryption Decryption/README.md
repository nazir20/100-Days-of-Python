# Caesar Cipher

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
In this program you could both encode and decode your secret messages.
```bash
EX:
  encode: Let's meet at 5 in Istanbul!
  shiftAmount = 5
  decoded: qjy'x rjjy fy 5 ns nxyfsgzq!
```
